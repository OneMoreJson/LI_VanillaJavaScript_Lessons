I archiving some of the repo and reorganizing my folders.  I found that while I am completing lesson plans on subjects, I have things organized in my local drives focused on where I get the training rather than the subject.  However, I want to keep my repos down, so I think I should focus on subject and then the learning organization I get the training.  This probably doesn’t mean anything to anyone, but I think right now would be a good time to adjust everything so I can focus on what matters… learning the skills and information.

Started this read me file and this series on how to be a VJS Dev because college courses are often not the greatest resource for learning new content.  I do believe they are important and a degree shows (1) that you can work according to what is required, (2) teamwork, (3) and you are committed.  Self learning shows many of these traits to include focus, discipline, and motivation.  After going through some of these courses, I plan to start working on both my own projects and open source work.

This Readme file is designed the way I do all my work.  I keeping a running log of the work submitted that day.  This is actually how I keep my private repos.
